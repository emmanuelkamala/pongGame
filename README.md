# Pong Game

This is a game design using Phaser 3 framework. The name of the game is called Pong. 

# How to Play

Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.

But in this design there is going to be one Player that is going to play with the computer. The game has a scoring system, were by if a player misses hitting the ball, then a score is added to the counter player and vice versa.
